# The JavaScript Curriculum
## A JavaScript Curriculum for Active Learners

### About
This curriculum is meant to equip you with the resources you need to get yourself up to speed with JavaScript as a language, and use it to create full and complete solutions. Motivating yourself to learn something new can be a challenge, thusly this curriculum is focused on the learning-by-doing methodology.

This curriculum heavily realies on [NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io) for the best self-learning experience.

### How to Ask for Help
The Internet is a vast cache of information and if you know how to navigatge it well, you can become a very effective learner.

- Always and always Google what you're looking for first. If what you're looking for isn't in the first page of results, then try again with different query.
- Prefer [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) links or got there directly.
- If the above strategies fail, then feel free the [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/excellalabs/the-javascript-curriculum/issues) on this repo. 
- Always provide full and complete information when asking for help.
- Specific questions are far more likely to get answered, than general/generic questions.

### Absolute Beginners
- [ ] Open up command line/console. Type in `node`, do you see `> `? If yes *great*, hit `Ctrl+C` to terminate the currently running `node` process. If no, then see `How to ask for help`.
- [ ] Type in `npm`, do you see `Usage: npm <command>`?
- You're ready to start learning, using the self guided workshoppers. Good luck!
